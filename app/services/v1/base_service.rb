module V1
  # Base service class with common functionality
  #
  # This class serves as a foundation for all service classes in the V1 namespace.
  # Currently kept minimal to avoid over-engineering.
  #
  # Future functionality may include:
  # - Common form validation helpers
  # - Logging and monitoring patterns
  # - Error handling standardization
  # - Performance tracking
  # - Caching helpers
  # - Background job integration
  # - Audit logging
  # - Multi-tenancy support
  # - Feature flags integration
  # - External API integration helpers
  # - Security and compliance utilities
  #
  # Add functionality only when patterns emerge across multiple services (YAGNI principle)
  class BaseService
    # TODO: Add common functionality as needed
  end
